Data and scripts for manuscript: "Chromatin structure influences rate and spectrum of spontaneous mutations in Neurospora crassa"

This was a fairly large and complex project. I've separated the different pipelines, input files, and analyses into different files.

## Statistical analysis of mutation data

File curated_mutations_final.csv contains the mutations that occurred in the MA lines. This is the final set of mutations after manual inspection in IGV and Sanger confirmation.
File mutationsscripts.R contains R scripts that are needed to process some of the mutation data

Folder /data contains .RData files that contain intermediate steps and results of statistical analyses.
